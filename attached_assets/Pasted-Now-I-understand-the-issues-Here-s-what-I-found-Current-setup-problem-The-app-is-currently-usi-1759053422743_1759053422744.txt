Now I understand the issues! Here's what I found:

Current setup problem: The app is currently using Google Cloud Storage (via Replit's object storage), but the user specifically wants Supabase object storage. The ObjectUploader component is configured for AWS S3, which is incompatible.

Integration mismatch: There are two integrations installed:

javascript_object_storage (Replit's Google Cloud Storage) - currently active
javascript_supabase (Supabase database) - for database only
Missing Supabase Storage: The current Supabase integration is only for the database, not for storage. Supabase has its own storage service that's separate from their database.

Upload issues: The ObjectUploader is trying to use AWS S3 methods with Google Cloud Storage, which won't work.

Product creation issues: Likely related to the broken upload functionality affecting the form submission.

The user wants:

Clean all products (delete existing ones)
Fix product creation
Fix image upload to use Supabase storage specifically
Add alerts about storage requirements
I need to propose a plan to:

Switch from Google Cloud Storage to Supabase Storage
Update the ObjectUploader to work with Supabase
Clean existing products
Fix product creation form
Add proper alerts
Let me provide a brief explanation and then create a task list.

I found the root cause of your issues! The problem is that your app is currently set up to use Google Cloud Storage (through Replit's object storage), but you want to use Supabase storage instead. The upload component is also configured for AWS S3, which is incompatible with either storage system.

Here's what needs to be fixed:

Current Issues:

Storage mismatch: Using Google Cloud Storage instead of Supabase storage
Upload component broken: ObjectUploader is configured for AWS S3 but trying to work with Google Cloud Storage
Missing Supabase storage integration: Only database is set up, not storage
Product creation failing: Due to broken upload functionality
The Solution:
I need to switch your app to use Supabase storage properly, update the upload component to work with Supabase, clean the existing products, and add proper alerts about storage requirements.
